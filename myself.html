                 <p> I learned very quickly that life will not give you lemons to make lemonade, lemons are man-made, just like my life, I made that happen, not other people. Hi, my name is Ijlah Wajihah Abdul Hadi. Let's get to know me. ♡⁠(⁠Ӧ⁠ｖ⁠Ӧ⁠｡⁠)</p>
                 <p>When I meet new people, they often comment on how unique my name is. They claimed they had never heard of my name. I used to dislike my name, but as time has passed, I have grown to appreciate it, which I believe is rather unique HAHAHAH. I also have difficulty meeting persons born on April 28. Am I truly special? Okay, I am just kidding. I was born in Kuala Lumpur but live in Selangor. When I have to introduce myself, I feel really confused because I reside in Klang, but not exactly in Klang. Life is quite tough. Hug to me. (⁠╯⁠︵⁠╰⁠,⁠)</p>

                 <p>One of my favorite pastimes is watching comfort dramas/movies. These are the kinds of shows or movies that you can watch over and over again, and they never fail to make you feel better.</p>

                 <p>I have an expensive hobby where all my hobbies cost money. That's why I'm getting poorer (⁠･ั⁠ω⁠･ั⁠). One of them is buying a novel, not reading novels, but these days, after I entered university, I have no time and no mood to read anymore. Still, let's pray that I don't waste money buying novels again 
but don't read them, my mother will be mad at me. Another hobby that I spend the most money on is buying albums and PCs. Arghh, I'm very easily agitating again - seeing handsome men again agitates me. Hmm, the complicated life of an Ijlah Wajihah. Eh but actually, I'm in a ban-buying phase which means stopping buying all that but I think I want to buy boynextdoor album hmm.</p>

    <h3 class="title">My Comfort Food</h3>
    <p>Comfort food is a big part of my life. It brings back nostalgic memories and offers a sense of warmth and happiness. Whether it's a bowl of creamy mac and cheese, a plate of spicy noodles, or a rich chocolate cake, these dishes always manage to lift my spirits.</p>
    <p>Cooking these comfort foods is not just about eating; it's about the process of making them. The smell of ingredients blending, the sound of sizzling pans, and the sight of a perfectly cooked meal bring a unique joy that is hard to find elsewhere.</p></p>
